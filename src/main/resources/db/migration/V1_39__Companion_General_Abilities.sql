Any number of models may have this ability, but it can only be successfully used once per warband per game. The first time a model with this ability is taken out-of-action, the warband’s leader must attempt a Mettle Test. On a failure, nothing happens and play continues, though the test can be taken again the next time a model with this ability is taken out-of-action. If this test is successful, the player may place a rank and file model (the model’s type and equipment will be delineated in the warband’s roster) within 6" of the warband’s starting deployment point. This represents the arrival of additional reinforcements. This new model may be activated on the turn it arrives, but it has only 1 AP and may only make a move action this turn. The model counts as a normal member of the warband, but leaves after the game and does not gain experience, receive income, etc. Replaceable may not be used if the warband’s leader is out-of-action or unconscious.');
