Compact weapons may be used to Burst fire even if the carrier used a move action this turn. As long as they moved and fired the weapon at least once, they gain the additional AP to fire again.

If a model uses a drug, drink, etc. with this special rule, the model must pass a Mettle test (TN 10) at the end of the game. Add +2 to the TN if the model used the same type of concoction during the previous game before this one. If the test is passed they avoid any issues. On a failure, the model must suffer a -2 to their Mettle stat during the next campaign game as the brew ravages their system. Tribal Berserkers ignore this rule as they have developed quite an immunity from overuse.');
